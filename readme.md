# Google Books Search
## Responsive React app for searching Google Books and saving favorites

## Overview
This app utilizes the Google Books API to let the user search for a book by title. It displays a beautiful list of matching books, complete with the book's image and details about each book. The user can click Save to add a book to their favorites. The favorites page displays any books the user has saved, and these may be removed individually. In both the search and saved views, the user can simply click the title or image of a book to view it on Google Books.

## Technologies
This is a full MERN app with Node serving assets, Express providing API routes, MongoDB storing saved books and Mongoose managing communication between the API and the database. On the front end is a fully responsive, interactive React app using Bootstrap for basic styling.
